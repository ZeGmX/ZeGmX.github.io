abstract: '<p align="justify">This paper presents and evaluates a set of mid-air ultrasound haptic strategies to provide 2-degree-of-freedom position and orientation guidance in Virtual Reality (VR). We devised four strategies for providing position guidance and two for providing orientation guidance. A human subject study evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in guiding users towards objectives in static and dynamic environments in VR, both in position and orientation. Results show that, compared to visual feedback of the virtual environment alone, the considered strategies significantly improve positioning performance in the static scenario. On the other hand, orientation guidance led to significant improvements only in the dynamic scenario.</p>'
